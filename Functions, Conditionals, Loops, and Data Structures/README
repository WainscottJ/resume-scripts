Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to test your ability to write Python functions that incorporate conditionals, loops, Boolean expressions,
and complex data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples. The context of this assignment focuses on cybersecurity, 
where you will audit user permissions and system vulnerabilities using Python.

Skills
In completing this assignment, you will practice and demonstrate your ability to:
1. Write Python functions to encapsulate functionality.
2. Use conditionals (if, elif, else) and Boolean expressions to control program flow.
3. Implement loops (for, while) to automate repetitive tasks.
4. Work with lists, dictionaries, and tuples to store, retrieve, and process data.
5. Apply these skills to real-world cybersecurity auditing scenarios.
                    
Knowledge
This assignment will deepen your knowledge of Python functions, data structures, and control flow. 
You will learn how to write modular and efficient code using loops, conditionals, and functions,
while handling complex data structures in the context of cybersecurity.
