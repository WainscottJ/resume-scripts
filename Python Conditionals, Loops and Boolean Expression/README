Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice using control flow structures (if-else, loops)
and Boolean expressions in Python to automate system monitoring tasks common in IT environments.
Mastering these concepts will enable you to write efficient scripts for automation, monitoring, and network diagnostics.

Skills
In this assignment, you will develop the following skills:
- Use of Python conditionals (if, elif, else) to handle complex decision-making scenarios.
- Use of loops (for, while) to automate repetitive tasks.
- Use of boolean and logical expressions (and, or, not) to handle multiple conditions efficiently.
- Handling multiple data sets (such as servers) and applying control flow logic to them.
- Writing clear and organized Python code for system automation.

Knowledge
This assignment will helped reinforce the following concepts:
- How to structure control flow in Python scripts.
- How to handle various logical conditions in real-world IT tasks.
- How to use loops to iterate over data, such as server lists, logs, or network connections.
