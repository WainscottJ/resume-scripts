Purpose
This assignment will help you:
• Deepen your understanding of Python error handling in real-world cybersecurity contexts.
• Implement advanced validation mechanisms to secure password inputs.
• Handle complex errors and integrate security-focused programming techniques like rate limiting and layered validation.

Skills
By completing this assignment, you will improve your ability to:
• Use custom exceptions and advanced try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle a range of error scenarios.
• Implement rate limiting and other security best practices in user authentication systems.
• Debug complex error chains and build error-resilient, secure Python programs.

Knowledge
This assignment reinforced my understanding of:
• Error handling techniques for cybersecurity-focused applications.
• Complex password validation policies and common attack vectors.
• How to write secure, robust Python code that can handle errors efficiently in high-security contexts.
