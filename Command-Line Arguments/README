Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment is to give you hands-on experience with Python scripts that handle individual
command-line arguments and optional parameters. This will help you design flexible scripts that take input directly from the command line, 
making your scripts adaptable for IT automation.

Skills:
- Defining and using command-line arguments in Python scripts.
- Parsing and validating individual command-line options and arguments.
- Structuring code into reusable functions.
- Implementing more complex logic for error and threshold handling.

Knowledge:
By the end of this assignment, have learned:
- How to handle command-line arguments using Pythonâ€™s argparse module.
- How to implement and use both positional and optional arguments.
- How to organize your script into functions for reusability and modularity.
- How to validate user input and handle more complex threshold logic.
